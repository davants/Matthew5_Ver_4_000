Triangle Mesh Clockwise and Counter Clockwise
	This is about "Front-Facing" and "Back-Facing" triangles. 
	If a rasterizer is set to "Clockwise", then "Front-Facing" triangles are in clockwise order 
	in terms of their vertex points. If the rasterizer is set to "Counterclockwise" then 
	"Front-Facing" triangles are in counterclockwise order.

	DirectX uses the D3D11_RASTERIZER_DESC struct for setting things up.
	This struct has the bool FrontCounterClockwise member so it can support either way.
